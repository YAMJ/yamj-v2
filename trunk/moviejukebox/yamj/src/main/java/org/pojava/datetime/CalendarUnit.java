/**
 * A CalendarUnit represents a time interval whose duration is allowed to vary in order to
 * adjust to Daylight Saving Time where needed.
 * 
 * The fundamental difference between CalendarUnit and Duration is that calculations performed
 * with CalendarUnit will seek to match an equivalent time of day should a DST to non-DST
 * boundary be crossed, whereas calculations with Duration will simply add a fixed unit of time.
